# About Me
- I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Mathametics.
- My main area of expertise is Machine Learning, specifically **Transformer** models in **Natural Language Processing**. An overview of the domains I have experience with:
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
  - Audio models
- Some technolgoies I excel at are:
  - **Ruby on Rails** for backend development
  - **AWS** for cloud services for system design & practical ML

# My Projects

## EMU Course Search

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=aws,rails,postgres,ruby,py,js&perline=20)](https://skillicons.dev)

An alternate to EMU's course search that allows you look up courses based on avaliability schedules. It consists of a full-stack application hosted on AWS, with a PostgreSQL database, a Ruby on Rails backend (api) and a JavaScript frontend.

## CodeContext (Private)

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=pytorch,py&perline=20)](https://skillicons.dev)

Research project that utilizes outside context to improve the performance of source-code Transformer models. Using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Library, architected and trained models on the CodeSearchNet dataset. 


## WishConnect 

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rails,sqlite,ruby,py,js&perline=20)](https://skillicons.dev)

A communication solution made for the Make-A-Wish Georgia Foundation as part of the Morgan Sanley Code-to-Give Hackathon (Alpharetta) 2023. Consists of a chatbot based on OpenAI's GPT and a Ruby on Raills web app.

## eBay Machine Learning Competition 2023 (Private)

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=pytorch,py&perline=20)](https://skillicons.dev)

A transformer model trained on German eBay listing titles for Named Entity Recognition. Model pretrained on an MLM task on 10,000,000 examples, and further fine-tuned on a downstream NER task. After conducting hyperparameter search, optimal model achieved 86% F1 score in the final competition ranking.


## Flight Booker

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=rails,ruby,js&perline=20)](https://skillicons.dev)

A Flight Booker app made in Ruby on Rails that allows users to search flights based on criteria and book them.
